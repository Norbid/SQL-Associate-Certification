# SQL-Associate-Certification
In another file in this repository is my code which I had to produce in order to get SQL associate certficate by DataCamp. 

To obtain the Associate SQL Certification, I had to demonstrate that I have the knowledge, skills, and abilities to successfully use SQL for data analysis. The competency domains assessed included, but were not limited to:
- data management (tasks relate mostly to data cleaning and processing. This includes identifying data quality issues, performing transformations and being able to work with data from multiple sources, typically multiple database tables. I was required to code specific cleaning and transformation tasks that can be applied to a given data source.)
- exploratory analysis (I was comfortable in calculatings metrics to effectively report characteristics of data and relationships between features using PostgreSQL.)
